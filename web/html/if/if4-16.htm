As additional information is gathered and the incident evolves, updated incident information is provided.  Incidents include any event that impacts transportation system operation ranging from routine incidents (e.g., disabled vehicle at the side of the road) through large&ndash;scale natural or human&ndash;caused disasters that involve loss of life, injuries, extensive property damage, and multi&ndash;jurisdictional response.  This also includes special events, closures, and other planned events that may impact the transportation system.</p><p><span class="emphasize">maint and constr resource coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Request for road maintenance and construction resources that can be used in the diversion of traffic (cones, portable signs), clearance of a road hazard,  repair of ancillary damage, or any other incident response.</p><p><span class="emphasize">maint and constr resource request</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Request for road maintenance and construction resources that can be used in the diversion of traffic (cones, portable signs), clearance of a road hazard,  repair of ancillary damage, or any other incident response.
