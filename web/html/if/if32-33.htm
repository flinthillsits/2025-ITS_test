<img src="../../images/ifs/if32-33.png" ALT="Fort Riley Emergency Management to Fort Riley Public Works Interface Diagram"><h3>Information Flow Definitions</h3><p><span class="emphasize">alert notification</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Notification of a major emergency such as a natural or man&ndash;made disaster, civil emergency, or child abduction for distribution to the public.  The flow identifies the alert originator, the nature of the emergency, the geographic area affected by the emergency, the effective time period, and information and instructions necessary for the public to respond to the alert.  This flow may also identify specific information that should not be released to the public.</p><p><span class="emphasize">alert status</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Information indicating the current status of the emergency alert including identification of the traveler and driver information systems that are being used to provide the alert.</p><p><span class="emphasize">emergency plan coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Information that supports coordination of emergency management plans, continuity of operations plans, emergency response and recovery plans, evacuation plans, and other emergency plans between agencies.  This includes general plans that are coordinated prior to an incident and shorter duration tactical plans that are prepared during an incident.</p><p><span class="emphasize">emergency traffic control information</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Status of a special traffic control strategy or system activation implemented in response to an emergency traffic control request, a request for emergency access routes, a request for evacuation, a request to activate closure systems, a request to employ driver information systems to support public safety objectives, or other special requests.  Identifies the selected traffic control strategy and system control status.</p><p><span class="emphasize">emergency traffic control request</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Special request to preempt the current traffic control strategy in effect at one or more signalized intersections or highway segments, activate traffic control and closure systems such as gates and barriers, activate safeguard systems, or use driver information systems.  For example, this flow can request all signals to red&ndash;flash, request a progression of traffic control preemptions along an emergency vehicle route, request a specific evacuation traffic control plan, request activation of a road closure barrier system, or place a public safety or emergency&ndash;related message on a dynamic message sign.</p><p><span class="emphasize">evacuation information</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Evacuation instructions and information including evacuation zones, evacuation times, and reentry times.</p><p><span class="emphasize">incident response status</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Status of the current incident response including a summary of incident status and its impact on the transportation system, traffic management strategies implemented at the site (e.g., closures, diversions, traffic signal control overrides), and current and planned response activities.</p><p><span class="emphasize">resource deployment status</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Status of resource deployment identifying the resources (vehicles, equipment, materials, and personnel) available and their current status.  General resource inventory information and specific status of deployed resources may be included.</p><p><span class="emphasize">resource request</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">A request for resources to implement special traffic control measures, assist in clean up, verify an incident, etc.  The request may poll for resource availability or request pre&ndash;staging, staging, or immediate deployment of resources.  Resources may be explicitly requested or a service may be requested and the specific resource deployment may be determined by the responding agency.</p><p><span class="emphasize">road network conditions</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Current and forecasted traffic information, road and weather conditions, and other road network status.  Either raw data, processed data, or some combination of both may be provided by this flow.  Information on diversions and alternate routes, closures, and special traffic restrictions (lane/shoulder use, weight restrictions, width restrictions, HOV requirements) in effect is included.</p><p><span class="emphasize">road network status assessment</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Assessment of damage sustained by the road network including location and extent of the damage, estimate of remaining capacity, required closures, alternate routes, necessary restrictions, and time frame for repair and recovery.</p><p><span class="emphasize">transportation system status</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Current status and condition of transportation infrastructure (e.g., tunnels, bridges, interchanges, TMC offices, maintenance facilities).  In case of disaster or major incident, this flow provides an assessment of damage sustained by the surface transportation system including location and extent of the damage, estimate of remaining capacity and necessary restrictions, and time frame for repair and recovery.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
