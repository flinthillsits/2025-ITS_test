  <h2>Interface: Manhattan Traffic Signals - Manhattan Bicycle Detection System</h2>
<img src="../../images/ifs/if8-84.png" ALT="Manhattan Traffic Signals to Manhattan Bicycle Detection System Interface Diagram"><h3>Information Flow Definitions</h3><p><span class="emphasize">barrier system coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment. This includes information used to configure and control barrier systems that are represented by gates, barriers and other automated or remotely controlled systems used to manage entry to roadways. Current operating status of barrier systems is also shared including operating condition and current operational state.</p><p><span class="emphasize">dynamic sign coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment. This includes information used to initialize, configure, and control  dynamic message signs.  This flow can provide message content and delivery attributes, local message store maintenance requests, control mode commands, status queries, and all other commands and associated parameters that support local management of these devices.  Current operating status of dynamic message signs is returned.</p><p><span class="emphasize">environmental sensor coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment.  This includes configuration and control of environmental sensors and the current road conditions (e.g., surface temperature, subsurface temperature, moisture, icing, treatment status) and surface weather conditions (e.g., air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, visibility) as measured and reported by fixed and/or mobile environmental sensors.  Operational status of the sensors is also included.</p><p><span class="emphasize">right-of-way request coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment. This includes notification of crossing calls from pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and requests for signal prioritization or preemption, and any other request for right&ndash;of&ndash;way at an intersection.  The status of the request is also shared.  For vulnerable road users, this includes information provided to guide and warn vulnerable road users at crossings including crossing permission status and crossing time remaining.</p><p><span class="emphasize">roadway warning coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment. This includes information used to configure and control roadway warning systems and the current operating status of roadway warning systems.</p><p><span class="emphasize">signal control coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment. This includes configuration and control of traffic signal controllers or field masters. Configuration data and operational status of traffic signal control equipment including operating condition and current indications are returned.</p><p><span class="emphasize">traffic detector coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment.  This includes information used to configure and control traffic detector systems such as inductive loop detectors and machine vision sensors  Raw and/or processed traffic detector data is returned that allows derivation of traffic flow variables (e.g., speed, volume, and density measures) and associated information (e.g., congestion, potential incidents).  This flow includes the traffic data and the operational status of the traffic detectors</p><p><span class="emphasize">traffic metering coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment. This includes control commands and operating parameters for ramp meters, interchange meters, mainline meters, and other systems equipment associated with roadway metering operations.  Current operational status of the traffic metering status is also provided.</p><p><span class="emphasize">video surveillance coordination</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The direct flow of information between field equipment. This includes information used to configure and control video surveillance systems and the high fidelity, real&ndash;time traffic images and associated meta data that are returned.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
