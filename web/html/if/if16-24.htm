This may be a request for ingress or egress routes or other emergency routes.    It may also include a request for preemption/priority for the identified vehicle at all signalized intersections along the route.</p><p><span class="emphasize">emergency routes</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Suggested ingress and egress routes for access to and between the scene and staging areas or other specialized emergency access routes.</p><p><span class="emphasize">emergency traffic control information</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Status of a special traffic control strategy or system activation implemented in response to an emergency traffic control request, a request for emergency access routes, a request for evacuation, a request to activate closure systems, a request to employ driver information systems to support public safety objectives, or other special requests.  Identifies the selected traffic control strategy and system control status.</p><p><span class="emphasize">emergency traffic control request</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Special request to preempt the current traffic control strategy in effect at one or more signalized intersections or highway segments, activate traffic control and closure systems such as gates and barriers, activate safeguard systems, or use driver information systems.  For example, this flow can request all signals to red&ndash;flash, request a progression of traffic control preemptions along an emergency vehicle route, request a specific evacuation traffic control plan, request activation of a road closure barrier system, or place a public safety or emergency&ndash;related message on a dynamic message sign.</p><p><span class="emphasize">evacuation information</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Evacuation instructions and information including evacuation zones, evacuation times, and reentry times.</p><p><span class="emphasize">incident information</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Notification of existence of incident and expected severity, location, time and nature of incident.  As additional information is gathered and the incident evolves, updated incident information is provided.  Incidents include any event that impacts transportation system operation ranging from routine incidents (e.g., disabled vehicle at the side of the road) through large&ndash;scale natural or human&ndash;caused disasters that involve loss of life, injuries, extensive property damage, and multi&ndash;jurisdictional response.  This also includes special events, closures, and other planned events that may impact the transportation system.</p><p><span class="emphasize">incident response status</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Status of the current incident response including a summary of incident status and its impact on the transportation system, traffic management strategies implemented at the site (e.g., closures, diversions, traffic signal control overrides), and current and planned response activities.</p><p><span class="emphasize">maint and constr resource request</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Request for road maintenance and construction resources that can be used in the diversion of traffic (cones, portable signs), clearance of a road hazard,  repair of ancillary damage, or any other incident response.  The request may poll for resource availability or request pre&ndash;staging, staging, or immediate dispatch of resources.</p><p><span class="emphasize">maint and constr resource response</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Existing)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Current status of maintenance and construction resources including availability and deployment status.  General resource inventory information covering vehicles, equipment, materials, and people and specific resource deployment status may be included.</p><p><span class="emphasize">remote surveillance control</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">The control commands used to remotely operate another center's sensors or surveillance equipment so that roadside surveillance assets can be shared by more than one agency.</p><p><span class="emphasize">resource deployment status</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Planned)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selected Comm Solution</a></p><p class="interface">Status of resource deployment identifying the resources (vehicles, equipment, materials, and personnel) available and their current status.
