<h3>Status: Existing</h3><h3>Description</h3><p>This element represents the Statewide center for KHP communications for Highway Patrol operations. This statewide central call taking and dispatching center receives incident/emergency calls from travelers who dial *47 (HP) or the listed KHP telephone number. The center also receives calls related to state highway incidents and emergencies which are transferred by county 911 centers. The center dispatches a full range of emergency medical, towing and other incident response personnel. The KHP Communications Center is located in Salina.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Stakeholder</th><th scope="col">Role</th><th scope="col">Role Status</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" ><a href="../stake/stake10.htm">Kansas Highway Patrol</a></th><td>Owns</td><td>Existing</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun24-57.htm">Emergency Management Center</a></th></tr></table><h3>Functional Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Functional Object</th><th scope="col">Description</th><th scope="col">User Defined</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Call&ndash;Taking</th><td>'Emergency Call&ndash;Taking' supports the emergency call&ndash;taker, collecting available information about the caller and the reported emergency, and forwarding this information to other objects that formulate and manage the emergency response.  It receives 9&ndash;1&ndash;1, 7&ndash;digit local access, and motorist call&ndash;box calls and interfaces to other agencies to assist in the verification and assessment of the emergency and to forward the emergency information to the appropriate response agency.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Dispatch</th><td>'Emergency Dispatch' tracks the location and status of emergency vehicles and dispatches these vehicles to incidents.  Pertinent incident information is gathered from the public and other public safety agencies and relayed to the responding units.  Incident status and the status of the responding units is tracked so that additional units can be dispatched and/or unit status can be returned to available when the incident is cleared and closed.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Early Warning System</th><td>'Emergency Early Warning System' monitors alerting and advisory systems, information collected by ITS surveillance and sensors, and reports from other agencies and uses this information to identify potential, imminent, or in&ndash;progress major incidents or disasters.  Notification is provided to initiate the emergency response, including public notification using ITS traveler information systems, where appropriate.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Environmental Monitoring</th><td>'Emergency Environmental Monitoring' collects current and forecast road conditions and surface weather information from a variety of sources.  The collected environmental information is monitored and presented to the operator and used to more effectively manage incidents.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Evacuation Support</th><td>'Emergency Evacuation Support' coordinates evacuation plans among allied agencies and manages evacuation and reentry of a population in the vicinity of a disaster or other emergency that poses a risk to public safety.  Where appropriate, the affected population is evacuated in shifts, using more than one evacuation route, and including several evacuation destinations to spread demand and thereby expedite the evacuation.  All affected jurisdictions (e.g., states and counties) at the evacuation origin, evacuation destination, and along the evacuation route are informed of the plan.  The public is provided with real&ndash;time evacuation guidance including basic information to assist potential evacuees in determining whether evacuation is necessary.  Resource requirements are forecast based on the evacuation plans, and the necessary resources are located, shared between agencies if necessary, and deployed at the right locations at the appropriate times.  The evacuation and reentry status are monitored and used to refine the plan and resource allocations during the evacuation and subsequent reentry.  It communicates with public health systems to develop evacuation plans and recommended strategies for disasters and evacuation scenarios involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Incident Command</th><td>'Emergency Incident Command' provides tactical decision support, resource coordination, and communications integration for Incident Commands that are established by first responders at or near the incident scene to support local management of an incident.  It supports communications with public safety, emergency management, transportation, and other allied response agency centers, tracks and maintains resource information, action plans, and the incident command organization itself.  Information is shared with agency centers including resource deployment status, hazardous material information, traffic, road, and weather conditions, evacuation advice, and other information that enables emergency or maintenance personnel in the field to implement an effective, safe incident response.  It supports the functions and interfaces commonly supported by a mobile command center.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Response Management</th><td>'Emergency Response Management' provides the strategic emergency response capabilities and broad inter&ndash;agency interfaces that are implemented for extraordinary incidents and disasters that require response from outside the local community.  It provides the functional capabilities and interfaces commonly associated with Emergency Operations Centers.  It develops and stores emergency response plans and manages overall coordinated response to emergencies.  It monitors real&ndash;time information on the state of the regional transportation system including current traffic and road conditions, weather conditions, special event and incident information.  It tracks the availability of resources and assists in the appropriate allocation of these resources for a particular emergency response.  It also provides coordination between multiple allied agencies before and during emergencies to implement emergency response plans and track progress through the incident.  It also coordinates with the public through the Emergency Telecommunication Systems (e.g., Reverse 911).  It coordinates with public health systems to provide the most appropriate response for emergencies involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Routing</th><td>'Emergency Routing' supports routing of emergency vehicles and enlists support from the Traffic Management Center to facilitate travel along these routes.  Routes may be determined based on real&ndash;time traffic information and road conditions or routes may be provided by the Traffic Management Center on request.  Vehicles are tracked and routes are based on current vehicle location.  It may coordinate with the Traffic Management Center to provide preemption or otherwise adapt the traffic control strategy along the selected route.  It may also coordinate with Transportation Information Centers to notify other drivers of public safety vehicles that are enroute.</td><td>False</td></tr></table><h3 class="float-left-context">Interfaces To</h3><p class="top-context"><a href="../if/ctx24.htm">(View Context Diagram)</a></p><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if1-24.htm">FHATA Automated Dispatch/AVL</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-32.htm">Fort Riley Emergency Management</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-43.htm">Geary County Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if16-24.htm">Junction City Engineering Department</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-27.htm">Junction City Police / 911 Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-51.htm">Kansas Homeland Security</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-48.htm">Kansas State Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-34.htm">KDOT District 1 Office</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-36.htm">KDOT District 2 Office</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-79.htm">KDOT RWIS Central Server</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-62.htm">KDOT Statewide TOC</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-25.htm">KHP Troop C</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-26.htm">KHP Troop C Vehicles</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if4-24.htm">Manhattan Traffic Operations Facility</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-66.htm">Media Outlets</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-65.htm">National Weather Service</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-63.htm">Neighboring 911 Centers</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-64.htm">Neighboring County Emergency Operations Centers</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-54.htm">Pottawatomie County Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-49.htm">Pottawatomie County Sheriff Office / 911 Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-24.htm">Riley County 911 Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-37.htm">Riley County Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if24-81.htm">Riley County Mobile Emergency Command Post</a></th></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
