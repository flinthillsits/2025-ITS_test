  <h2>Riley County 911 Center</h2>
<h3>Status: Existing</h3><h3>Description</h3><p>Riley County 911 Center is the public safety answering point for both Riley County and City of Manhattan. The center is responsible for emergency response and emergency vehicle dispatch.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Stakeholder</th><th scope="col">Role</th><th scope="col">Role Status</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" ><a href="../stake/stake1.htm">Riley County Police Department</a></th><td>Owns</td><td>Existing</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun17-57.htm">Emergency Management Center</a></th></tr></table><h3>Functional Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Functional Object</th><th scope="col">Description</th><th scope="col">User Defined</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Call&ndash;Taking</th><td>'Emergency Call&ndash;Taking' supports the emergency call&ndash;taker, collecting available information about the caller and the reported emergency, and forwarding this information to other objects that formulate and manage the emergency response.  It receives 9&ndash;1&ndash;1, 7&ndash;digit local access, and motorist call&ndash;box calls and interfaces to other agencies to assist in the verification and assessment of the emergency and to forward the emergency information to the appropriate response agency.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Dispatch</th><td>'Emergency Dispatch' tracks the location and status of emergency vehicles and dispatches these vehicles to incidents.  Pertinent incident information is gathered from the public and other public safety agencies and relayed to the responding units.  Incident status and the status of the responding units is tracked so that additional units can be dispatched and/or unit status can be returned to available when the incident is cleared and closed.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Early Warning System</th><td>'Emergency Early Warning System' monitors alerting and advisory systems, information collected by ITS surveillance and sensors, and reports from other agencies and uses this information to identify potential, imminent, or in&ndash;progress major incidents or disasters.  Notification is provided to initiate the emergency response, including public notification using ITS traveler information systems, where appropriate.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Evacuation Support</th><td>'Emergency Evacuation Support' coordinates evacuation plans among allied agencies and manages evacuation and reentry of a population in the vicinity of a disaster or other emergency that poses a risk to public safety.  Where appropriate, the affected population is evacuated in shifts, using more than one evacuation route, and including several evacuation destinations to spread demand and thereby expedite the evacuation.  All affected jurisdictions (e.g., states and counties) at the evacuation origin, evacuation destination, and along the evacuation route are informed of the plan.  The public is provided with real&ndash;time evacuation guidance including basic information to assist potential evacuees in determining whether evacuation is necessary.  Resource requirements are forecast based on the evacuation plans, and the necessary resources are located, shared between agencies if necessary, and deployed at the right locations at the appropriate times.  The evacuation and reentry status are monitored and used to refine the plan and resource allocations during the evacuation and subsequent reentry.  It communicates with public health systems to develop evacuation plans and recommended strategies for disasters and evacuation scenarios involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Incident Command</th><td>'Emergency Incident Command' provides tactical decision support, resource coordination, and communications integration for Incident Commands that are established by first responders at or near the incident scene to support local management of an incident.  It supports communications with public safety, emergency management, transportation, and other allied response agency centers, tracks and maintains resource information, action plans, and the incident command organization itself.  Information is shared with agency centers including resource deployment status, hazardous material information, traffic, road, and weather conditions, evacuation advice, and other information that enables emergency or maintenance personnel in the field to implement an effective, safe incident response.  It supports the functions and interfaces commonly supported by a mobile command center.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Response Management</th><td>'Emergency Response Management' provides the strategic emergency response capabilities and broad inter&ndash;agency interfaces that are implemented for extraordinary incidents and disasters that require response from outside the local community.  It provides the functional capabilities and interfaces commonly associated with Emergency Operations Centers.  It develops and stores emergency response plans and manages overall coordinated response to emergencies.  It monitors real&ndash;time information on the state of the regional transportation system including current traffic and road conditions, weather conditions, special event and incident information.  It tracks the availability of resources and assists in the appropriate allocation of these resources for a particular emergency response.  It also provides coordination between multiple allied agencies before and during emergencies to implement emergency response plans and track progress through the incident.  It also coordinates with the public through the Emergency Telecommunication Systems (e.g., Reverse 911).  It coordinates with public health systems to provide the most appropriate response for emergencies involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr></table><h3 class="float-left-context">Interfaces To</h3><p class="top-context"><a href="../if/ctx17.htm">(View Context Diagram)</a></p><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if1-17.htm">FHATA Automated Dispatch/AVL</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-43.htm">Geary County Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-27.htm">Junction City Police / 911 Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-48.htm">Kansas State Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-24.htm">KHP Communications Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-53.htm">K&ndash;State Police Department</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-61.htm">Manhattan Emergency Vehicles</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-59.htm">Manhattan Fire Department</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if4-17.htm">Manhattan Traffic Operations Facility</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-66.htm">Media Outlets</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-63.htm">Neighboring 911 Centers</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-64.htm">Neighboring County Emergency Operations Centers</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-54.htm">Pottawatomie County Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-49.htm">Pottawatomie County Sheriff Office / 911 Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-37.htm">Riley County Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-19.htm">Riley County Emergency Vehicles</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-60.htm">Riley County Fire Department</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-81.htm">Riley County Mobile Emergency Command Post</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if17-38.htm">Riley County Public Works</a></th></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
