  <h2>Junction City Maintenance and Construction Vehicles - Maint and Constr Vehicle OBE Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>The 'Maint and Constr Vehicle OBE' resides in a maintenance, construction, or other specialized service vehicle or equipment and provides the  processing, storage, and communications functions necessary to support highway maintenance and construction.  All types of maintenance and construction vehicles are covered, including heavy equipment, supervisory vehicles, unmanned remote controlled field maintenance robots, and sensory platforms that may be wheeled or low altitude aerial vehicles (e.g. drones, balloons).  The MCV OBE provides two&ndash;way communications between  drivers/operators and dispatchers and maintains and communicates current location and status information.  A wide range of operational status is monitored, measured, and made available, depending on the specific type of vehicle or equipment.  A snow plow for example, would monitor whether the plow is up or down and material usage information.  The Maint and Constr Vehicle OBE may also contain capabilities to monitor vehicle systems to support maintenance of the vehicle itself.  A separate 'Vehicle OBE' physical object supports the general vehicle safety and driver information capabilities that apply to all vehicles, including maintenance and construction vehicles.  The Maint and Constr Vehicle OBE supplements these general capabilities with capabilities that are specific to maintenance and construction vehicles.</p><h3>Functional Object: MCV Roadway Maintenance and Construction</h3><p>'MCV Roadway Maintenance and Construction' includes the on&ndash;board systems that support routine non&ndash;winter maintenance on a roadway system or right&ndash;of&ndash;way.  Routine maintenance includes landscape maintenance, hazard removal (roadway debris, dead animals), routine maintenance activities (roadway cleaning, grass cutting), and repair and maintenance of both ITS and non&ndash;ITS equipment on the roadway (e.g., signs, traffic controllers, traffic detectors, dynamic message signs, traffic signals, etc.).</p><h3>Functional Object: MCV Vehicle Location Tracking</h3><p>'MCV Vehicle Location Tracking' monitors vehicle location and reports the position and timestamp information to the dispatch center.</p><h3>Functional Object: MCV Winter Maintenance</h3><p>'MCV Winter Maintenance' supports snow plow operations and other roadway treatments (e.g., salt spraying and other material applications).  It supports communications with the center to receive information and instructions that are provided to the vehicle operator and also supports remote control of on&ndash;board systems.  It tracks operational status of snow and ice control operations and provides this information back to the center.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
