  <h2>Manhattan Bluetooth Readers</h2>
<h3>Status: Existing</h3><h3>Description</h3><p>The City of Manhattan installed 3 Bluetooth readers and the associate reporting software and sever to provide travel time and speed reporting along K&ndash;113. As of 2016, 12 additional Bluetooth readers were installed on two additional arterials within the city. The corridors selected are K&ndash;18 from East Poyntz Avenue to 17th Street, and Heritage Square on US&ndash;24 through US&ndash;24 and McCall Road along the McCall Road arterial. Manhattan is also applying for a grant from KDOT to install Bluetooth readers on 6 or so signals along the US&ndash;24/Tuttle Creek Blvd corridor.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Stakeholder</th><th scope="col">Role</th><th scope="col">Role Status</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" ><a href="../stake/stake4.htm">City of Manhattan Public Works</a></th><td>Owns</td><td>Existing</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun67-9.htm">ITS Roadway Equipment</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun67-11.htm">Connected Vehicle Roadside Equipment</a></th></tr></table><h3>Functional Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Functional Object</th><th scope="col">Description</th><th scope="col">User Defined</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Roadway Passive Monitoring</th><td>'Roadway Passive Monitoring' monitors passing vehicles for a signature that can be used to recognize the same vehicle at different points in the network and measure travel times.  Depending on the implementation and the penetration rate of the technology that is monitored, other point traffic measures may also be inferred by monitoring the number of vehicles within range over time.  Today this approach is implemented most commonly using a Bluetooth receiver that passively monitors Bluetooth devices on&ndash;board passing vehicles and license plate readers that record the vehicle license plate number, but any widely deployed vehicle communications technology or feature that can be passively monitored to uniquely identify a vehicle could be used.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >RSE Device Management</th><td>'RSE Device Management' provides executive control and monitoring of the RSE hardware and installed software applications.  It monitors the operational status of the hardware and other attached field devices and detects and reports fault conditions.  A back office interface supports application installation, upgrade, and configuration as well as remote control of the operating mode and hardware configuration settings and initiation of remote diagnostics.  A local interface is provided to field personnel for local monitoring and diagnostics, supporting field maintenance, repair, and replacement.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >RSE Situation Monitoring</th><td>'RSE Situation Monitoring' is a general functional object that supports collection of traffic, environmental, and emissions data from passing vehicles.  The data is collected, filtered, and forwarded based on parameters provided by the back office.  Parameters are provided to passing vehicles that are equipped to collect and send situation data to the infrastructure in snapshots.  In addition, this object collects current status information from local field devices including intersection status, sensor data, and signage data, providing complete, configurable monitoring of the situation for the local transportation system in the vicinity of the RSE.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >RSE Traffic Monitoring</th><td>'RSE Traffic Monitoring' monitors the basic safety messages that are shared between connected vehicles and distills this data into traffic flow measures that can be used to manage the network in combination with or in lieu of traffic data collected by infrastructure&ndash;based sensors.  As connected vehicle penetration rates increase, the measures provided by this application can expand beyond vehicle speeds that are directly reported by vehicles to include estimated volume, occupancy, and other measures.  This object also supports incident detection by monitoring for changes in speed and vehicle control events that indicate a potential incident.</td><td>False</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Standards</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Document Number</th><th scope="col">Title</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >CTI 4001</th><td>Roadside Unit (RSU) Standard</td><td>This document establishes a non&ndash;proprietary, communications&ndash;agnostic, industry consensus Roadside Unit (RSU) Standard. An RSU is a transportation infrastructure communications device that is a part of a Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C&ndash;ITS) transportation environment. The goal of such an environment is to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on roadways, improve mobility, and reduce environmental impacts of transportation systems. Commonly known as the Connected Vehicle (CV) environment in the United States (US), it includes both connected human&ndash;driven vehicles and connected automated vehicles (CAVs). The terms Vehicle&ndash;to&ndash;Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle&ndash;to&ndash;Vehicle (V2V) are used to reflect the exchanges of messages within the CV environment. The vision for this technology has expanded to include all types of travelers including pedestrians, cyclists, multimodal travelers, and other vulnerable road users (VRUs), and is referred to as Vehicle&ndash;to&ndash;Everything (V2X) technology and V2X communications.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >ITE ATC 5301</th><td>Intelligent Transportation System Standard Specification for Roadside Cabinets</td><td>This standard specifies the characteristics of a modern controller cabinet for the ITS industry.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >NEMA TS 8</th><td>Cyber and Physical Security for Intelligent Transportation Systems</td><td>This specification describes how agencies and other transportation infrastructure owner/operators should implement cyber&ndash; and physical&ndash;security for ITS.</td></tr></table><h3 class="float-left-context">Interfaces To</h3><p class="top-context"><a href="../if/ctx67.htm">(View Context Diagram)</a></p><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if4-67.htm">Manhattan Traffic Operations Facility</a></th></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
