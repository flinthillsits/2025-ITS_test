  <h2>Manhattan Bluetooth Readers - Connected Vehicle Roadside Equipment Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>'Connected Vehicle Roadside Equipment' (CV RSE) represents the Connected Vehicle roadside devices (i.e., Roadside Units (RSUs)) equipped with short range wireless (SRW) communications technology, as well as any other supporting equipment that leverage the RSU and are not described by other objects (e.g., a local roadside processor). CVRSE are used to send messages to, and receive messages from, nearby vehicles and personal devices equipped with compatible communications technology.  Communications with adjacent field equipment and back office centers that monitor and control the RSE are also supported.  This device operates from a fixed position and may be permanently deployed or a portable device that is located temporarily in the vicinity of a traffic incident, road construction, or a special event.   It includes a processor, data storage, and communications capabilities that support secure communications with passing vehicles, other field equipment, and centers.</p><h3>Functional Object: RSE Device Management</h3><p>'RSE Device Management' provides executive control and monitoring of the RSE hardware and installed software applications.  It monitors the operational status of the hardware and other attached field devices and detects and reports fault conditions.  A back office interface supports application installation, upgrade, and configuration as well as remote control of the operating mode and hardware configuration settings and initiation of remote diagnostics.  A local interface is provided to field personnel for local monitoring and diagnostics, supporting field maintenance, repair, and replacement.</p><h3>Functional Object: RSE Situation Monitoring</h3><p>'RSE Situation Monitoring' is a general functional object that supports collection of traffic, environmental, and emissions data from passing vehicles.  The data is collected, filtered, and forwarded based on parameters provided by the back office.  Parameters are provided to passing vehicles that are equipped to collect and send situation data to the infrastructure in snapshots.  In addition, this object collects current status information from local field devices including intersection status, sensor data, and signage data, providing complete, configurable monitoring of the situation for the local transportation system in the vicinity of the RSE.</p><h3>Functional Object: RSE Traffic Monitoring</h3><p>'RSE Traffic Monitoring' monitors the basic safety messages that are shared between connected vehicles and distills this data into traffic flow measures that can be used to manage the network in combination with or in lieu of traffic data collected by infrastructure&ndash;based sensors.  As connected vehicle penetration rates increase, the measures provided by this application can expand beyond vehicle speeds that are directly reported by vehicles to include estimated volume, occupancy, and other measures.  This object also supports incident detection by monitoring for changes in speed and vehicle control events that indicate a potential incident.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
