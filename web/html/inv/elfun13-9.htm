  <h2>Junction City Traffic Signals - ITS Roadway Equipment Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>'ITS Roadway Equipment' represents the ITS equipment that is distributed on and along the roadway that monitors and controls traffic and monitors and manages the roadway.  This physical object includes traffic detectors, environmental sensors, traffic signals, highway advisory radios, dynamic message signs, CCTV cameras and video image processing systems, grade crossing warning systems, and ramp metering systems.  Lane management systems and barrier systems that control access to transportation infrastructure such as roadways, bridges and tunnels are also included.  This object also provides environmental monitoring including sensors that measure road conditions, surface weather, and vehicle emissions.  Work zone systems including work zone surveillance, traffic control, driver warning, and work crew safety systems are also included.</p><h3>Functional Object: Roadway Field Management Station Operation</h3><p>'Roadway Field Management Station Operation' supports direct communications between field management stations and the local field equipment under their control.</p><h3>Functional Object: Roadway Signal Control</h3><p>'Roadway Signal Control' includes the field elements that monitor and control signalized intersections.  It includes the traffic signal controllers, detectors, conflict monitors, signal heads, and other ancillary equipment that supports traffic signal control.  It also includes field masters, and equipment that supports communications with a central monitoring and/or control system, as applicable.  The communications link supports upload and download of signal timings and other parameters and reporting of current intersection status.  It represents the field equipment used in all levels of traffic signal control from basic actuated systems that operate on fixed timing plans through adaptive systems.  It also supports all signalized intersection configurations, including those that accommodate pedestrians.  In advanced, future implementations, environmental data may be monitored and used to support dilemma zone processing and other aspects of signal control that are sensitive to local environmental conditions.</p><h3>Functional Object: Roadway Signal Preemption</h3><p>'Roadway Signal Preemption' includes the field elements that receive signal preemption requests from trains, boats (i.e., drawbridge crossings), emergency vehicles, or light rail transit vehicles approaching a signalized intersection and overrides the current operation of the traffic signals to stop conflicting traffic and grant right&ndash;of&ndash;way to the approaching vehicle.  This functional object also services preemption requests received from a TMC to support implementations where the preemption requests are managed by the center.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
