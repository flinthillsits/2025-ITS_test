  <h2>Manhattan Fire Dept Digital Information Boards - Emergency Management Center Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>The 'Emergency Management Center' represents systems that support incident management, disaster response and evacuation, security monitoring, and other security and public safety&ndash;oriented ITS applications. It includes the functions associated with fixed and mobile public safety communications centers including public safety call taker and dispatch centers operated by police (including transit police), fire, and emergency medical services.  It includes the functions associated with Emergency Operations Centers that are activated at local, regional, state, and federal levels for emergencies and the portable and transportable systems that support Incident Command System operations at an incident.  This Center also represents systems associated with towing and recovery, freeway service patrols, HAZMAT response teams, and mayday service providers.<br /><br />It manages sensor and surveillance equipment used to enhance transportation security of the roadway infrastructure (including bridges, tunnels, interchanges, and other key roadway segments) and the public transportation system (including transit vehicles, public areas such as transit stops and stations, facilities such as transit yards, and transit infrastructure such as rail, bridges, tunnels, or bus guideways). It provides security/surveillance services to improve traveler security in public areas not a part of the public transportation system.<br /><br />It monitors alerts, advisories, and other threat information and prepares for and responds to identified emergencies.  It coordinates emergency response involving multiple agencies with peer centers. It stores, coordinates, and utilizes emergency response and evacuation plans to facilitate this coordinated response.   Emergency situation information including damage assessments, response status, evacuation information, and resource information are shared The Emergency Management Center also provides a focal point for coordination of the emergency and evacuation information that is provided to the traveling public, including wide&ndash;area alerts when immediate public notification is warranted.<br /><br />It tracks and manages emergency vehicle fleets using real&ndash;time road network status and routing information from the other centers  to aid in selecting the emergency vehicle(s) and routes,  and works with other relevant centers to tailor traffic control to support emergency vehicle ingress and egress, implementation of special traffic restrictions and closures, evacuation traffic control plans, and other special strategies that adapt the transportation system to better meet the unique demands of an emergency.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
