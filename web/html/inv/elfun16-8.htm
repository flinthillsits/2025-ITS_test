  <h2>Junction City Engineering Department - Maint and Constr Management Center Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>The 'Maint and Constr Management Center' monitors and manages roadway infrastructure construction and maintenance activities.  Representing both public agencies and private contractors that provide these functions, this physical object manages fleets of maintenance, construction, or special service vehicles (e.g., snow and ice control equipment).  The physical object receives a wide range of status information from these vehicles and performs vehicle dispatch, routing, and resource management for the vehicle fleets and associated equipment.  The physical object participates in incident response by deploying maintenance and construction resources to an incident scene, in coordination with other center physical objects.  The physical object manages equipment at the roadside, including environmental sensors and automated systems that monitor and mitigate adverse road and surface weather conditions.  It manages the repair and maintenance of both non&ndash;ITS and ITS equipment including the traffic controllers, detectors, dynamic message signs, signals, and other equipment associated with the roadway infrastructure.  Weather information is collected and fused with other data sources and used to support advanced decision support systems.<br /><br />The physical object remotely monitors and manages ITS capabilities in work zones, gathering, storing, and disseminating work zone information to other systems.  It manages traffic in the vicinity of the work zone and advises drivers of work zone status (either directly at the roadside or through an interface with the Transportation Information Center or Traffic Management Center physical objects.)<br /><br />Construction and maintenance activities are tracked and coordinated with other systems, improving the quality and accuracy of information available regarding closures and other roadway construction and maintenance activities.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
