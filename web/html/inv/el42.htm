Notification is provided to initiate the emergency response, including public notification using ITS traveler information systems, where appropriate.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Evacuation Support</th><td>'Emergency Evacuation Support' coordinates evacuation plans among allied agencies and manages evacuation and reentry of a population in the vicinity of a disaster or other emergency that poses a risk to public safety.  Where appropriate, the affected population is evacuated in shifts, using more than one evacuation route, and including several evacuation destinations to spread demand and thereby expedite the evacuation.  All affected jurisdictions (e.g., states and counties) at the evacuation origin, evacuation destination, and along the evacuation route are informed of the plan.  The public is provided with real&ndash;time evacuation guidance including basic information to assist potential evacuees in determining whether evacuation is necessary.  Resource requirements are forecast based on the evacuation plans, and the necessary resources are located, shared between agencies if necessary, and deployed at the right locations at the appropriate times.  The evacuation and reentry status are monitored and used to refine the plan and resource allocations during the evacuation and subsequent reentry.  It communicates with public health systems to develop evacuation plans and recommended strategies for disasters and evacuation scenarios involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Incident Command</th><td>'Emergency Incident Command' provides tactical decision support, resource coordination, and communications integration for Incident Commands that are established by first responders at or near the incident scene to support local management of an incident.  It supports communications with public safety, emergency management, transportation, and other allied response agency centers, tracks and maintains resource information, action plans, and the incident command organization itself.  Information is shared with agency centers including resource deployment status, hazardous material information, traffic, road, and weather conditions, evacuation advice, and other information that enables emergency or maintenance personnel in the field to implement an effective, safe incident response.  It supports the functions and interfaces commonly supported by a mobile command center.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Response Management</th><td>'Emergency Response Management' provides the strategic emergency response capabilities and broad inter&ndash;agency interfaces that are implemented for extraordinary incidents and disasters that require response from outside the local community.  It provides the functional capabilities and interfaces commonly associated with Emergency Operations Centers.  It develops and stores emergency response plans and manages overall coordinated response to emergencies.  It monitors real&ndash;time information on the state of the regional transportation system including current traffic and road conditions, weather conditions, special event and incident information.  It tracks the availability of resources and assists in the appropriate allocation of these resources for a particular emergency response.  It also provides coordination between multiple allied agencies before and during emergencies to implement emergency response plans and track progress through the incident.  It also coordinates with the public through the Emergency Telecommunication Systems (e.g., Reverse 911).  It coordinates with public health systems to provide the most appropriate response for emergencies involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr></table><h3 class="float-left-context">Interfaces To</h3><p class="top-context"><a href="../if/ctx42.htm">(View Context Diagram)</a></p><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if42-43.htm">Geary County Emergency Operations Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if42-50.htm">Geary County Emergency Vehicles</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if27-42.htm">Junction City Police / 911 Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if42-81.htm">Riley County Mobile Emergency Command Post</a></th></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
