  <h2>KDOT District 1 Office - Maint and Constr Management Center Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>The 'Maint and Constr Management Center' monitors and manages roadway infrastructure construction and maintenance activities.  Representing both public agencies and private contractors that provide these functions, this physical object manages fleets of maintenance, construction, or special service vehicles (e.g., snow and ice control equipment).  The physical object receives a wide range of status information from these vehicles and performs vehicle dispatch, routing, and resource management for the vehicle fleets and associated equipment.  The physical object participates in incident response by deploying maintenance and construction resources to an incident scene, in coordination with other center physical objects.  The physical object manages equipment at the roadside, including environmental sensors and automated systems that monitor and mitigate adverse road and surface weather conditions.  It manages the repair and maintenance of both non&ndash;ITS and ITS equipment including the traffic controllers, detectors, dynamic message signs, signals, and other equipment associated with the roadway infrastructure.  Weather information is collected and fused with other data sources and used to support advanced decision support systems.<br /><br />The physical object remotely monitors and manages ITS capabilities in work zones, gathering, storing, and disseminating work zone information to other systems.  It manages traffic in the vicinity of the work zone and advises drivers of work zone status (either directly at the roadside or through an interface with the Transportation Information Center or Traffic Management Center physical objects.)<br /><br />Construction and maintenance activities are tracked and coordinated with other systems, improving the quality and accuracy of information available regarding closures and other roadway construction and maintenance activities.</p><h3>Functional Object: MCM Environmental Information Collection</h3><p>'MCM Environmental Information Collection' collects current road and weather conditions using data collected from environmental sensors deployed on and about the roadway.  In addition to fixed sensor stations at the roadside, this functional object also collects environmental information from sensor systems located on Maintenance and Construction Vehicles.  It also collects current and forecast environmental conditions information that is made available by other systems.  The functional object aggregates the sensor system data and provides it, along with data attributes to other applications.</p><h3>Functional Object: MCM Incident Management</h3><p>'MCM Incident Management' supports maintenance and construction participation in coordinated incident response.  Incident notifications are shared, incident response resources are managed, and the overall incident situation and incident response status is coordinated among allied response organizations.</p><h3>Functional Object: MCM Roadway Maintenance</h3><p>'MCM Roadway Maintenance' provides overall management and support for routine maintenance on a roadway system or right&ndash;of&ndash;way.  Services managed include landscape maintenance, hazard removal (roadway debris, dead animals), routine maintenance activities (roadway cleaning, grass cutting), and repair and maintenance of non&ndash;ITS equipment on the roadway (e.g., signs, gantries, cabinets, guard rails, etc.).  Environmental conditions information is also received from various weather sources to aid in scheduling routine maintenance activities.  See also MCM Field Equipment Maintenance for maintenance of ITS field equipment.</p><h3>Functional Object: MCM Winter Maintenance Management</h3><p>'MCM Winter Maintenance Management' manages winter road maintenance, tracking and controlling snow plow operations, roadway treatment (e.g., salt spraying and other material applications), and other snow and ice control operations.  It monitors environmental conditions and weather forecasts and uses the information to schedule winter maintenance activities, determine the appropriate snow and ice control response, and track and manage response operations.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
