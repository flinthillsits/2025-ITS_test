  <h2>Manhattan Traffic Information Website - Transportation Information Center Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>The 'Transportation Information Center' collects, processes, stores, and disseminates transportation information to system operators and the traveling public.  The physical object can play several different roles in an integrated ITS.  In one role, the TIC provides a data collection, fusing, and repackaging function, collecting information from transportation system operators and redistributing this information to other system operators in the region and other TICs.  In this information redistribution role, the TIC provides a bridge between the various transportation systems that produce the information and the other TICs and their subscribers that use the information.   The second role of a TIC is focused on delivery of traveler information to subscribers and the public at large.  Information provided includes basic advisories, traffic and road conditions, transit schedule information, yellow pages information, ride matching information, and parking information. The TIC is commonly implemented as a website or a web&ndash;based application service, but it represents any traveler information distribution service.</p><h3>Functional Object: TIC Data Collection</h3><p>'TIC Data Collection' collects transportation&ndash;related data from other centers, performs data quality checks on the collected data and then consolidates, verifies, and refines the data and makes it available in a consistent format to applications that support operational data sharing between centers and deliver traveler information to end&ndash;users.  A broad range of data is collected including traffic and road conditions, transit data, emergency information and advisories, weather data, special event information, traveler services, parking, multimodal data, and toll/pricing data.  It also shares data with other transportation information centers.</p><h3>Functional Object: TIC Emergency Traveler Information</h3><p>'TIC Emergency Traveler Information' provides emergency information to the public, including wide&ndash;area alerts and evacuation information.  It provides emergency alerts, information on evacuation zones and evacuation requirements, evacuation destinations and shelter information, available transportation modes, and traffic and road conditions at the origin, destination, and along the evacuation routes.  In addition to general evacuation information, personalized information including tailored evacuation routes, service information, and estimated travel times is also provided based on traveler specified origin, destination, and route parameters.  Updated information is provided throughout the evacuation and subsequent reentry as status changes and plans are adapted.</p><h3>Functional Object: TIC Traveler Information Broadcast</h3><p>'TIC Traveler Information Broadcast' disseminates traveler information including traffic and road conditions, incident information, maintenance and construction information, event information, transit information, parking information, and weather information.  The same information is broadcast to all equipped traveler interface systems and vehicles.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
