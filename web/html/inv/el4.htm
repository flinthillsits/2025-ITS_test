In addition to fixed sensor stations at the roadside, this functional object also collects environmental information from sensor systems located on Maintenance and Construction Vehicles.  It also collects current and forecast environmental conditions information that is made available by other systems.  The functional object aggregates the sensor system data and provides it, along with data attributes to other applications.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >MCM Environmental Information Processing</th><td>'MCM Environmental Information Processing' processes current and forecast weather data, road condition information, local environmental data, and uses internal models to develop specialized detailed forecasts of local weather and surface conditions.  The processed environmental information products are presented to center personnel and disseminated to other centers.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Basic Surveillance</th><td>'TMC Basic Surveillance' remotely monitors and controls traffic sensor systems and surveillance (e.g., CCTV) equipment, and collects, processes and stores the collected traffic data.  Current traffic information and other real&ndash;time transportation information is also collected from other centers.  The collected information is provided to traffic operations personnel and made available to other centers.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Environmental Monitoring</th><td>'TMC Environmental Monitoring' assimilates current and forecast road conditions and surface weather information using a combination of weather service provider information, information collected by other centers such as the Maintenance and Construction Management Center, data collected from environmental sensors deployed on and about the roadway, and information collected from connected vehicles.  The collected environmental information is monitored and presented to the operator.  This information can be used to issue general traveler advisories and support location specific warnings to drivers.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Evacuation Support</th><td>'TMC Evacuation Support' supports development, coordination, and execution of special traffic management strategies during evacuation and subsequent reentry of a population in the vicinity of a disaster or major emergency.  A traffic management strategy is developed based on anticipated demand, the capacity of the road network including access to and from the evacuation routes, and existing and forecast conditions.  The strategy supports efficient evacuation and also protects and optimizes movement of response vehicles and other resources that are responding to the emergency.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Incident Detection</th><td>'TMC Incident Detection' identifies and reports incidents to Traffic Operations Personnel.  It remotely monitors and controls traffic sensor and surveillance systems that support incident detection and verification.  It analyzes and reduces the collected sensor and surveillance data, external alerting and advisory and incident reporting systems, anticipated demand information from intermodal freight depots, border crossings, special event information, and identifies and reports incidents and hazardous conditions</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Incident Dispatch Coordination</th><td>'TMC Incident Dispatch Coordination' formulates and manages an incident response that takes into account the incident potential, incident impacts, and resources required for incident management.  It provides information to support dispatch and routing of emergency response and service vehicles as well as coordination with other cooperating agencies.  It provides access to traffic management resources that provide surveillance of the incident, traffic control in the surrounding area, and support for the incident response.  It monitors the incident response and collects performance measures such as incident response and clearance times.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Passive Surveillance</th><td>'TMC Passive Surveillance' collects time stamped vehicle identities from different detection zones, correlates the identities, and calculates link travel times and derives other traffic measures.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Regional Traffic Management</th><td>'TMC Regional Traffic Management' supports coordination between Traffic Management Centers in order to share traffic information between centers as well as control of traffic management field equipment.  This coordination supports wide area optimization and regional coordination that spans jurisdictional boundaries; for example, coordinated signal control in a metropolitan area or coordination between freeway operations and arterial signal control within a corridor.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Roadway Equipment Monitoring</th><td>'TMC Roadway Equipment Monitoring' monitors the operational status of field equipment and detects failures.  It presents field equipment status to Traffic Operations Personnel and reports failures to the Maintenance and Construction Management Center.  It tracks the repair or replacement of the failed equipment.  The entire range of ITS field equipment may be monitored including sensors (traffic, infrastructure, environmental, security, speed, etc.) and devices (highway advisory radio, dynamic message signs, automated roadway treatment systems, barrier and safeguard systems, cameras, traffic signals and override equipment, ramp meters, beacons, security surveillance equipment, etc.).</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Signal Control</th><td>'TMC Signal Control' provides the capability for traffic managers to monitor and manage the traffic flow at signalized intersections.  This capability includes analyzing and reducing the collected data from traffic surveillance equipment and developing and implementing control plans for signalized intersections.  Control plans may be developed and implemented that coordinate signals at many intersections under the domain of a single Traffic Management Center and are responsive to traffic conditions and adapt to support incidents, preemption and priority requests, pedestrian crossing calls, etc.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Situation Data Management</th><td>'TMC Situation Data Management' collects, assimilates, and disseminates vehicle probe data collected from roadside short range communications equipment and centers controlling transit vehicles, toll collection points, and route&ndash;guided vehicles.  It estimates traffic and road conditions based on the aggregated probe data and disseminates this information to other centers.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Traffic Information Dissemination</th><td>'TMC Traffic Information Dissemination' disseminates traffic and road conditions, closure and detour information, incident information, driver advisories, and other traffic&ndash;related data to other centers, the media, and driver information systems.  It monitors and controls driver information system field equipment including dynamic message signs and highway advisory radio, managing dissemination of driver information through these systems.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >TMC Work Zone Traffic Management</th><td>'TMC Work Zone Traffic Management' coordinates work plans with maintenance systems so that work zones are established that have minimum traffic impact.  Traffic control strategies are implemented to further mitigate traffic impacts associated with work zones that are established, providing work zone information to driver information systems such as dynamic message signs.</td><td>False</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Standards</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Document Number</th><th scope="col">Title</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >NEMA TS 8</th><td>Cyber and Physical Security for Intelligent Transportation Systems</td><td>This specification describes how agencies and other transportation infrastructure owner/operators should implement cyber&ndash;
