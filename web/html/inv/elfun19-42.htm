  <h2>Riley County Emergency Vehicles - Emergency Vehicle OBE Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>The 'Emergency Vehicle On&ndash;Board Equipment' (OBE) resides in an emergency vehicle and provides the processing, storage, and communications functions that support public safety&ndash;related connected vehicle applications.   It represents a range of vehicles including those operated by police, fire, and emergency medical services.  In addition, it represents other incident response vehicles including towing and recovery vehicles and freeway service patrols.  It includes two&ndash;way communications to support coordinated response to emergencies.  A separate 'Vehicle OBE' physical object supports the general vehicle safety and driver information capabilities that apply to all vehicles, including emergency vehicles.  The Emergency Vehicle OBE supplements these general capabilities with capabilities that are specific to emergency vehicles.</p><h3>Functional Object: EV On-Board En Route Support</h3><p>'EV On&ndash;Board En Route Support' provides communications functions to responding emergency vehicles that reduce response times and improve safety of responding public safety personnel and the general public.  It supports traffic signal preemption via short range communication directly with signal control equipment.</p><h3>Functional Object: EV Service Patrol Vehicle Operations</h3><p>'EV Service Patrol Vehicle Operations' provides on&ndash;board processing and communications to service patrol vehicles that reduce response times and improve safety of responding personnel.  It supports service patrol vehicle dispatch and provides incident information back to the dispatching center.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
