  <h2>Kansas State Emergency Operations Center - Emergency Management Center Functionality</h2>
<h3>Subsystem Description</h3><p>The 'Emergency Management Center' represents systems that support incident management, disaster response and evacuation, security monitoring, and other security and public safety&ndash;oriented ITS applications. It includes the functions associated with fixed and mobile public safety communications centers including public safety call taker and dispatch centers operated by police (including transit police), fire, and emergency medical services.  It includes the functions associated with Emergency Operations Centers that are activated at local, regional, state, and federal levels for emergencies and the portable and transportable systems that support Incident Command System operations at an incident.  This Center also represents systems associated with towing and recovery, freeway service patrols, HAZMAT response teams, and mayday service providers.<br /><br />It manages sensor and surveillance equipment used to enhance transportation security of the roadway infrastructure (including bridges, tunnels, interchanges, and other key roadway segments) and the public transportation system (including transit vehicles, public areas such as transit stops and stations, facilities such as transit yards, and transit infrastructure such as rail, bridges, tunnels, or bus guideways). It provides security/surveillance services to improve traveler security in public areas not a part of the public transportation system.<br /><br />It monitors alerts, advisories, and other threat information and prepares for and responds to identified emergencies.  It coordinates emergency response involving multiple agencies with peer centers. It stores, coordinates, and utilizes emergency response and evacuation plans to facilitate this coordinated response.   Emergency situation information including damage assessments, response status, evacuation information, and resource information are shared The Emergency Management Center also provides a focal point for coordination of the emergency and evacuation information that is provided to the traveling public, including wide&ndash;area alerts when immediate public notification is warranted.<br /><br />It tracks and manages emergency vehicle fleets using real&ndash;time road network status and routing information from the other centers  to aid in selecting the emergency vehicle(s) and routes,  and works with other relevant centers to tailor traffic control to support emergency vehicle ingress and egress, implementation of special traffic restrictions and closures, evacuation traffic control plans, and other special strategies that adapt the transportation system to better meet the unique demands of an emergency.</p><h3>Functional Object: Emergency Early Warning System</h3><p>'Emergency Early Warning System' monitors alerting and advisory systems, information collected by ITS surveillance and sensors, and reports from other agencies and uses this information to identify potential, imminent, or in&ndash;progress major incidents or disasters.  Notification is provided to initiate the emergency response, including public notification using ITS traveler information systems, where appropriate.</p><h3>Functional Object: Emergency Evacuation Support</h3><p>'Emergency Evacuation Support' coordinates evacuation plans among allied agencies and manages evacuation and reentry of a population in the vicinity of a disaster or other emergency that poses a risk to public safety.  Where appropriate, the affected population is evacuated in shifts, using more than one evacuation route, and including several evacuation destinations to spread demand and thereby expedite the evacuation.  All affected jurisdictions (e.g., states and counties) at the evacuation origin, evacuation destination, and along the evacuation route are informed of the plan.  The public is provided with real&ndash;time evacuation guidance including basic information to assist potential evacuees in determining whether evacuation is necessary.  Resource requirements are forecast based on the evacuation plans, and the necessary resources are located, shared between agencies if necessary, and deployed at the right locations at the appropriate times.  The evacuation and reentry status are monitored and used to refine the plan and resource allocations during the evacuation and subsequent reentry.  It communicates with public health systems to develop evacuation plans and recommended strategies for disasters and evacuation scenarios involving biological or other medical hazards.</p><h3>Functional Object: Emergency Incident Command</h3><p>'Emergency Incident Command' provides tactical decision support, resource coordination, and communications integration for Incident Commands that are established by first responders at or near the incident scene to support local management of an incident.  It supports communications with public safety, emergency management, transportation, and other allied response agency centers, tracks and maintains resource information, action plans, and the incident command organization itself.  Information is shared with agency centers including resource deployment status, hazardous material information, traffic, road, and weather conditions, evacuation advice, and other information that enables emergency or maintenance personnel in the field to implement an effective, safe incident response.  It supports the functions and interfaces commonly supported by a mobile command center.</p><h3>Functional Object: Emergency Response Management</h3><p>'Emergency Response Management' provides the strategic emergency response capabilities and broad inter&ndash;agency interfaces that are implemented for extraordinary incidents and disasters that require response from outside the local community.  It provides the functional capabilities and interfaces commonly associated with Emergency Operations Centers.  It develops and stores emergency response plans and manages overall coordinated response to emergencies.  It monitors real&ndash;time information on the state of the regional transportation system including current traffic and road conditions, weather conditions, special event and incident information.  It tracks the availability of resources and assists in the appropriate allocation of these resources for a particular emergency response.  It also provides coordination between multiple allied agencies before and during emergencies to implement emergency response plans and track progress through the incident.  It also coordinates with the public through the Emergency Telecommunication Systems (e.g., Reverse 911).  It coordinates with public health systems to provide the most appropriate response for emergencies involving biological or other medical hazards.</p></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
