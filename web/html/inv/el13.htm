  <h2>Junction City Traffic Signals</h2>
<h3>Status: Existing</h3><h3>Description</h3><p>This element represents traffic signals owned and operated by Junction City. Traffic signals are not currently centrally monitored or controlled.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Stakeholder</th><th scope="col">Role</th><th scope="col">Role Status</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" ><a href="../stake/stake12.htm">City of Junction City Public Works</a></th><td>Owns</td><td>Existing</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun13-9.htm">ITS Roadway Equipment</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun13-11.htm">Connected Vehicle Roadside Equipment</a></th></tr></table><h3>Functional Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Functional Object</th><th scope="col">Description</th><th scope="col">User Defined</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Roadway Field Management Station Operation</th><td>'Roadway Field Management Station Operation' supports direct communications between field management stations and the local field equipment under their control.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Roadway Signal Control</th><td>'Roadway Signal Control' includes the field elements that monitor and control signalized intersections.  It includes the traffic signal controllers, detectors, conflict monitors, signal heads, and other ancillary equipment that supports traffic signal control.  It also includes field masters, and equipment that supports communications with a central monitoring and/or control system, as applicable.  The communications link supports upload and download of signal timings and other parameters and reporting of current intersection status.  It represents the field equipment used in all levels of traffic signal control from basic actuated systems that operate on fixed timing plans through adaptive systems.  It also supports all signalized intersection configurations, including those that accommodate pedestrians.  In advanced, future implementations, environmental data may be monitored and used to support dilemma zone processing and other aspects of signal control that are sensitive to local environmental conditions.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Roadway Signal Preemption</th><td>'Roadway Signal Preemption' includes the field elements that receive signal preemption requests from trains, boats (i.e., drawbridge crossings), emergency vehicles, or light rail transit vehicles approaching a signalized intersection and overrides the current operation of the traffic signals to stop conflicting traffic and grant right&ndash;of&ndash;way to the approaching vehicle.  This functional object also services preemption requests received from a TMC to support implementations where the preemption requests are managed by the center.</td><td>False</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Standards</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Document Number</th><th scope="col">Title</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >CTI 4001</th><td>Roadside Unit (RSU) Standard</td><td>This document establishes a non&ndash;proprietary, communications&ndash;agnostic, industry consensus Roadside Unit (RSU) Standard. An RSU is a transportation infrastructure communications device that is a part of a Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C&ndash;ITS) transportation environment. The goal of such an environment is to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on roadways, improve mobility, and reduce environmental impacts of transportation systems. Commonly known as the Connected Vehicle (CV) environment in the United States (US), it includes both connected human&ndash;driven vehicles and connected automated vehicles (CAVs). The terms Vehicle&ndash;to&ndash;Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle&ndash;to&ndash;Vehicle (V2V) are used to reflect the exchanges of messages within the CV environment. The vision for this technology has expanded to include all types of travelers including pedestrians, cyclists, multimodal travelers, and other vulnerable road users (VRUs), and is referred to as Vehicle&ndash;to&ndash;Everything (V2X) technology and V2X communications.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >ITE ATC 5201</th><td>Advanced Transportation Controller</td><td>This standard defines the functionality and performance requirements for a modern ITS controller known as an ATC. It is similar to the NEMA TS&ndash;2 standard in that it defines basic capabilities but leaves hardware choices up to the manufacturer.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >ITE ATC 5202</th><td>Model 2070 Controller Standard</td><td>This standard specifies the hardware for a modern, open&ndash;architecture controller for ITS applications that can run Linux and is capable of executing advanced signal controller logic, among other things.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >ITE ATC 5301</th><td>Intelligent Transportation System Standard Specification for Roadside Cabinets</td><td>This standard specifies the characteristics of a modern controller cabinet for the ITS industry.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >ITE ATC 5401</th><td>Application Programming Interface Standard for the Advanced Transportation Controller</td><td>This standard defines the application programmers' interface (API) that should be supported by an ATC, which is an open&ndash;architecture controller that can host multiple ITS applications.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >NEMA TS 8</th><td>Cyber and Physical Security for Intelligent Transportation Systems</td><td>This specification describes how agencies and other transportation infrastructure owner/operators should implement cyber&ndash; and physical&ndash;security for ITS.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >NEMA TS2</th><td>Traffic Controller Assemblies with NTCIP Requirements</td><td>This specification covers traffic signaling equipment used to facilitate and expedite the safe movement of pedestrians and vehicular traffic.</td></tr></table><h3 class="float-left-context">Interfaces To</h3><p class="top-context"><a href="../if/ctx13.htm">(View Context Diagram)</a></p><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if13-85.htm">Drivers</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if13-50.htm">Geary County Emergency Vehicles</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if13-29.htm">Junction City Emergency Vehicles</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if13-16.htm">Junction City Engineering Department</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if13-15.htm">Junction City Public Works Department</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../if/if4-13.htm">Manhattan Traffic Operations Facility</a></th></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
