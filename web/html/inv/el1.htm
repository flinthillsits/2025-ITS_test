  <h2>FHATA Automated Dispatch/AVL</h2>
<h3>Status: Planned</h3><h3>Description</h3><p>This element represents the FHATA Control/Dispatch Center. A new CAD/AVL system was procured through KDOT in 2016. In 2025, FHATA opted not to renew the KDOT contract and to procure a different product or products in the near term.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Stakeholder</th><th scope="col">Role</th><th scope="col">Role Status</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" ><a href="../stake/stake25.htm">FHATA</a></th><td>Owns</td><td>Existing</td></tr></table><h3>Physical Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun1-24.htm">Transit Management Center</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/elfun1-57.htm">Emergency Management Center</a></th></tr></table><h3>Functional Objects</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Functional Object</th><th scope="col">Description</th><th scope="col">User Defined</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Evacuation Support</th><td>'Emergency Evacuation Support' coordinates evacuation plans among allied agencies and manages evacuation and reentry of a population in the vicinity of a disaster or other emergency that poses a risk to public safety.  Where appropriate, the affected population is evacuated in shifts, using more than one evacuation route, and including several evacuation destinations to spread demand and thereby expedite the evacuation.  All affected jurisdictions (e.g., states and counties) at the evacuation origin, evacuation destination, and along the evacuation route are informed of the plan.  The public is provided with real&ndash;time evacuation guidance including basic information to assist potential evacuees in determining whether evacuation is necessary.  Resource requirements are forecast based on the evacuation plans, and the necessary resources are located, shared between agencies if necessary, and deployed at the right locations at the appropriate times.  The evacuation and reentry status are monitored and used to refine the plan and resource allocations during the evacuation and subsequent reentry.  It communicates with public health systems to develop evacuation plans and recommended strategies for disasters and evacuation scenarios involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Emergency Response Management</th><td>'Emergency Response Management' provides the strategic emergency response capabilities and broad inter&ndash;agency interfaces that are implemented for extraordinary incidents and disasters that require response from outside the local community.  It provides the functional capabilities and interfaces commonly associated with Emergency Operations Centers.  It develops and stores emergency response plans and manages overall coordinated response to emergencies.  It monitors real&ndash;time information on the state of the regional transportation system including current traffic and road conditions, weather conditions, special event and incident information.  It tracks the availability of resources and assists in the appropriate allocation of these resources for a particular emergency response.  It also provides coordination between multiple allied agencies before and during emergencies to implement emergency response plans and track progress through the incident.  It also coordinates with the public through the Emergency Telecommunication Systems (e.g., Reverse 911).  It coordinates with public health systems to provide the most appropriate response for emergencies involving biological or other medical hazards.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Transit Center Fixed&ndash;Route Operations</th><td>'Transit Center Fixed&ndash;Route Operations' manages fixed route transit operations.  It supports creation of schedules, blocks and runs for fixed and flexible route transit services.  It allows fixed&ndash;route and flexible&ndash;route transit services to disseminate schedules and automatically updates customer service operator systems with the most current schedule information.  It also supports automated dispatch of transit vehicles.  Current vehicle schedule adherence and optimum scenarios for schedule adjustment are also provided.  It also receives and processes transit vehicle loading data.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Transit Center Information Services</th><td>'Transit Center Information Services' collects the latest available information for a transit service and makes it available to transit customers and to Transportation Information Centers for further distribution.  Customers are provided information at transit stops and other public transportation areas before they embark and on&ndash;board the transit vehicle once they are en route.  Information provided can include the latest available information on transit routes, schedules, transfer options, fares, real&ndash;time schedule adherence, current incidents, weather conditions, yellow pages, and special events.  In addition to general service information, tailored information (e.g., itineraries) are provided to individual transit users.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Transit Center Paratransit Operations</th><td>'Transit Center Paratransit Operations' manages demand responsive transit services, including paratransit services.

Customer service operator systems are updated with the most current schedule information.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Transit Center Security</th><td>'Transit Center Security' monitors transit vehicle operator or traveler activated alarms received from on&ndash;board a transit vehicle.  It supports transit vehicle operator authentication and provides the capability to remotely disable a transit vehicle.  It also includes the capability to alert operators and police to potential incidents identified by these security features.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Transit Center Vehicle Assignment</th><td>'Transit Center Vehicle Assignment' assigns individual transit vehicles to vehicle blocks and downloads this information to the transit vehicle.  It also provides an exception handling process for the vehicle assignment function to generate new, supplemental vehicle assignments when required by changes during the operating day.  It provides an inventory management function for the transit facility which stores functional attributes about each of the vehicles owned by the transit operator.  These attributes permit the planning and assignment functions to match vehicles with routes based on suitability for the types of service required by the particular routes.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Transit Center Vehicle Tracking</th><td>'Transit Center Vehicle Tracking' monitors transit vehicle location.  The location information is collected via a data communication link between the transit vehicles and the transit center.  The location information is presented to the transit operator on a digitized map of the transit service area.  The location data may be used to determine real time schedule adherence and update the transit system's schedule in real&ndash;time.  The real&ndash;time schedule information is disseminated to other information providers, which furnish the information to travelers.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >Transit Evacuation Support</th><td>'Transit Evacuation Support' manages transit resources to support evacuation and subsequent reentry of a population in the vicinity of a disaster or other emergency.  It supports coordination of regional evacuation plans, identifying the transit role in a regional evacuation and identifying transit resources that would be used.  During an evacuation, it coordinates the use of transit and school bus fleets, supporting evacuation of those with special needs and the general population.
