  <h2>PS14: Disaster Traveler Information</h2>
<h3>Need Area Description</h3><p>This service package uses ITS to provide disaster&ndash;related traveler information to the general public, including evacuation and reentry information and other information concerning the operation of the transportation system during a disaster.  This service package collects information from multiple sources including traffic, transit, public safety, emergency management, shelter provider, and travel service provider organizations.  The collected information is processed and the public is provided with real&ndash;time disaster and evacuation information using ITS traveler information systems.<br /><br />A disaster will stress the surface transportation system since it may damage transportation facilities at the same time that it places unique demands on these facilities to support public evacuation and provide access for emergency responders.  Similarly, a disaster may interrupt or degrade the operation of many traveler information systems at the same time that safety&ndash;critical information must be provided to the traveling public.  This service package keeps the public informed in these scenarios, using all available means to provide information about the disaster area including damage to the transportation system, detours and closures in effect, special traffic restrictions and allowances, special transit schedules, and real&ndash;time information on traffic conditions and transit system performance in and around the disaster.<br /><br />This service package also provides emergency information to assist the public with evacuations when necessary.  Information on mandatory and voluntary evacuation zones, evacuation times, and instructions are provided.  Available evacuation routes and destinations and current and anticipated travel conditions along those routes are provided so evacuees are prepared and know their destination and preferred evacuation route.  Information on available transit services and traveler services (shelters, medical services, hotels, restaurants, gas stations, etc.) is also provided.  In addition to general evacuation information, this service package provides specific evacuation trip planning information that is tailored for the evacuee based on origin, selected destination, and evacuee&ndash;specified evacuation requirements and route parameters.<br /><br />This service package augments the Traveler Information (TI) service packages that provide traveler information on a day&ndash;to&ndash;day basis for the surface transportation system.  This service package provides focus on the special requirements for traveler information dissemination in disaster situations.</p><h3>Need Area Type: Safety</h3><h3>Service Package</h3><a href="../mp/mp187.htm">PS14: Disaster Traveler Information</a><h3>Includes Needs</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Number</th><th scope="col">Need</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >1</th><td>Emergency Management and Traveler Information need to be able to provide general public real&ndash;time disaster and evacuation information using ITS traveler information systems.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >2</th><td>Traveler Information needs to be able to collect disaster related information from multiple sources including traffic, transit, public safety, emergency management, shelter provider, and travel service provider organizations.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >3</th><td>Emergency Management and Traveler Information need to be able to provide evacuees with information including a shelter that matches their needs, including location, availability, and routing.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >4</th><td>Emergency Management and Traveler Information need to be able to provide information concerning roadside resources including information provided by other evacuees to help understand availability of resources.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >5</th><td>Emergency Management and Traveler Information need to be able to provide evacuees with information regarding when they can return to their area, including routes and road conditions.</td></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
