  <h2>Emergency Routing Functional Object</h2>
<h3>Description</h3><p>'Emergency Routing' supports routing of emergency vehicles and enlists support from the Traffic Management Center to facilitate travel along these routes.  Routes may be determined based on real&ndash;time traffic information and road conditions or routes may be provided by the Traffic Management Center on request.  Vehicles are tracked and routes are based on current vehicle location.  It may coordinate with the Traffic Management Center to provide preemption or otherwise adapt the traffic control strategy along the selected route.  It may also coordinate with Transportation Information Centers to notify other drivers of public safety vehicles that are enroute.</p><h3>Included In</h3><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/el24.htm">KHP Communications Center</a></th></tr></table><h3>Functional Requirements</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">ID</th><th scope="col">Requirement</th><th scope="col">User Defined</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >1</th><td>The center shall collect current traffic and road condition information for emergency vehicle route calculation.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >2</th><td>The center shall receive information on the location and status of traffic control equipment and work zones along potential emergency routes.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >3</th><td>The center shall receive status information from care facilities to determine the appropriate facility and its location.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >4</th><td>The center shall receive asset restriction information to support the dispatching of appropriate emergency resources.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >5</th><td>The center shall receive current railroad schedule information for emergency vehicle route calculation.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >6</th><td>The center shall track current emergency vehicle location and status along with other emergency vehicle characteristics.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >7</th><td>The center shall calculate emergency vehicle routes, under center personnel control, based on the collected traffic and road conditions information.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >8</th><td>The center shall request and receive ingress and egress routes or other specialized emergency access routes from the traffic management center.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >9</th><td>The center shall provide the capability to request special traffic control measures, such as signal preemption, from the traffic management center to facilitate emergency vehicle progress along the suggested route.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >10</th><td>The center shall provide the calculated route for emergency vehicles to the dispatch function.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >11</th><td>The center shall collect weather and maintenance activity data, e.g., which roads have been plowed to support emergency dispatch and staging of personnel and equipment.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >12</th><td>The center shall collect road and traffic conditions information, including current traffic conditions en route, current traffic conditions on&ndash;scene, and road weather conditions (e.g. wet, icy, snow&ndash;covered).</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >13</th><td>The center shall collect road and traffic conditions information from multiple sources including: traffic management centers, probe vehicle data, including traffic data and environmental conditions, and other private traffic data sources, e.g. private distributors that integrate connected (probe) vehicle data with cellular or surveillance device inputs.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >14</th><td>The center shall provide routing instructions for a dispatched emergency vehicle that may reflect current network conditions and the additional routing options available to en route emergency that are not available to the general public.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >15</th><td>The emergency center shall collect location and situational information about the emergency vehicles responding to or on the scene of an incident.</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >16</th><td>The center shall provide special vehicle alert information to a third party provider so that vehicles can be warned that are in the vicinity of the dispatched emergency vehicle.</td><td>False</td></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
