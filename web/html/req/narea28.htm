  <h2>WX01: Weather Data Collection</h2>
<h3>Need Area Description</h3><p>This service package collects current road and weather conditions using data collected from environmental sensors deployed on and about the roadway.  It also collects data from vehicles in the road network that can be used to directly measure or infer current environmental conditions.  It leverages vehicle on&ndash;board systems that measure temperature, sense current weather conditions (rain and sun sensors) and also can monitor aspects of the vehicle operational status (e.g., use of headlights, wipers, and traction control system) to gather information about local environmental conditions.  In addition, environmental sensor systems located on Maintenance and Construction Vehicles are also potential data sources. The collected environmental data is used by the Weather Information Processing and Distribution service package to process the information and make decisions on operations. The collected environmental data may be aggregated, combined with data attributes and sent to meteorological systems for data qualification and further data consolidation. The service package may also request and receive qualified data sets from meteorological systems.</p><h3>Need Area Type: Environmental</h3><h3>Service Package</h3><a href="../mp/mp143.htm">WX01: Weather Data Collection</a><h3>Includes Needs</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Number</th><th scope="col">Need</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >1</th><td>Traffic operations or maintenance and construction operations need be able to collect road conditions and weather data from environmental sensors on or in the vicinity of the roadway.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >2</th><td>Traffic operations need to be able to collect road conditions and weather data from vehicle on&ndash;board sensors.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >3</th><td>Traffic operations and maintenance and construction operations need to share collected environmental data with each other.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >4</th><td>Traffic operations and Maintenance and construction need to be able to receive environmental data from Weather operations.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >5</th><td>Maintenance and construction operations need to be able to collect road conditions and weather data from maintenance vehicle on&ndash;board sensors.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >6</th><td>Weather Systems need be able to collect road conditions and weather data from environmental sensors on or in the vicinity of the roadway.</td></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
