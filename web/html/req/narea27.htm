  <h2>VS12: Vulnerable Road User Safety</h2>
<h3>Need Area Description</h3><p>This service package supports the sensing and warning systems used to interact with pedestrians, cyclists, wheel chair users, scooter riders, and other vulnerable road users that are on pathways that are immediately adjacent to or intersect the roadway.  These systems allow automated warning or active protection for this class of users.  It integrates traffic and vulnerable road user information from roadside or intersection detectors and new forms of data from wirelessly connected, traveler&ndash;carried mobile devices to request right&ndash;of&ndash;way or to inform pedestrians when to cross and how to remain aligned with the crosswalk or pathway based on real&ndash;time Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) and MAP information. In some cases, priority will be given to non&ndash;motorized travelers, such as persons with disabilities who need additional crossing time, or in special conditions (e.g., weather) where non&ndash;motorized travelers may warrant priority or additional crossing time. This service package will enable a service call to be routed to the traffic controller from a mobile device of a registered person with disabilities after confirming the direction and orientation of the roadway that the individual is intending to cross.  It also provides warnings to the vulnerable road users of possible infringement of the crossing or pathway by approaching vehicles.</p><h3>Need Area Type: Mobility</h3><h3>Service Package</h3><a href="../mp/mp50.htm">VS12: Vulnerable Road User Safety</a><h3>Includes Needs</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Number</th><th scope="col">Need</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >1</th><td>Traffic Operations needs to be able to provide to connected vehicles an indication that pedestrians or micromobility vehicle users may be crossing or are crossing an intersection in order to reduce the likelihood of the vehicle striking the pedestrian or micromobility users.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >2</th><td>Traffic Operations needs to be able to warn pedestrians or micromobility vehicle users about crossing status or potential vehicle infringement into the crosswalk in order to allow the pedestrian or micromobility vehicle users to safely cross an intersection.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >3</th><td>Traffic Operations needs to be able to provide intersection priority for pedestrians or micromobility vehicle users based upon requests from the pedestrians or micromobility vehicle users.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >4</th><td>Traffic Operations needs to be able to inform pedestrians and micromobility vehicle users of the status of the intersection including the amount of time left for crossing the intersection.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >5</th><td>The Driver needs to receive warnings or have the vehicle automatically perform control actions relating to pedestrians, and vulnerable road users that are sharing the roadway with the vehicle.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >6</th><td>	Pedestrians need to be informed about potentially hazardous road conditions or vehicles that may pose a danger to them.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >7</th><td>	MMV Operators need to be informed about potentially hazardous road conditions or vehicles that may pose a danger to them.</td></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
