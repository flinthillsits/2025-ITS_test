  <h2>PT05: Transit Security</h2>
<h3>Need Area Description</h3><p>This service package provides for the physical security of transit passengers and transit vehicle operators.  On&ndash;board equipment performs surveillance and sensor monitoring in order to identify potentially hazardous situations.  The surveillance equipment includes video (e.g., CCTV cameras), audio systems and/or event recorder systems.  The sensor equipment includes threat sensors (e.g., chemical agent, toxic industrial chemical, biological, explosives, and radiological sensors) and object detection sensors (e.g., metal detectors).  Transit user or transit vehicle operator activated alarms are provided on&ndash;board.  Public areas (e.g., transit stops, park and ride lots, stations) are also monitored with similar surveillance and sensor equipment and provided with transit user activated alarms.  In addition this service package provides surveillance and sensor monitoring of non&ndash;public areas of transit facilities (e.g., transit yards) and transit infrastructure such as bridges, tunnels, and transit railways or bus rapid transit (BRT) guideways.  The surveillance equipment includes video and/or audio systems.  The sensor equipment includes threat sensors and object detection sensors as described above as well as, intrusion or motion detection sensors and infrastructure integrity monitoring (e.g., rail track continuity checking or bridge structural integrity monitoring).<br /><br />Most of the surveillance and sensor data that is collected by this service package may be monitored by either the Emergency Management Center or the Transit Management Center, providing two possible approaches to implementing this service package.  This service package also supports remote transit vehicle disabling and transit vehicle operator authentication by the Transit Management Center.</p><h3>Need Area Type: Mobility</h3><h3>Service Package</h3><a href="../mp/mp155.htm">PT05: Transit Security</a><h3>Includes Needs</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">Number</th><th scope="col">Need</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >1</th><td>Transit Operations needs to be able to monitor conditions on a transit vehicle in order to provide a secure environment for travelers.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >2</th><td>Transit Operations needs to be able to monitor transit stops and transit stations in order to provide a secure environment for travelers.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >3</th><td>Transit Operations needs to be able to monitor transit secure areas such as bus or rail yards and transit infrastructure such as tracks and tunnels in order to provide security for transit assets.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >4</th><td>Transit Operations needs to be able to authenticate operators of transit vehicles and perform remote disabling of vehicles if necessary in order to ensure secure operation of the vehicles.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >5</th><td>Transit Operations needs to be able to alert emergency services to incidents on vehicles, at stations/stops, or other monitored assets.</td></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >6</th><td>Transit Operations needs to be able to inform traveler information systems or the media regarding transit related incidents in order to keep the traveling public informed of the impacts these incidents may have on their trips.</td></tr></table></div> <!-- End of Content Div -->
