  <h2>TMC Incident Dispatch Coordination Functional Object</h2>
<h3>Description</h3><p>'TMC Incident Dispatch Coordination' formulates and manages an incident response that takes into account the incident potential, incident impacts, and resources required for incident management.  It provides information to support dispatch and routing of emergency response and service vehicles as well as coordination with other cooperating agencies.  It provides access to traffic management resources that provide surveillance of the incident, traffic control in the surrounding area, and support for the incident response.  It monitors the incident response and collects performance measures such as incident response and clearance times.</p><h3>Included In</h3><table><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/el4.htm">Manhattan Traffic Operations Facility</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/el16.htm">Junction City Engineering Department</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/el33.htm">Fort Riley Public Works</a></th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight"  class="sansBorder" ><a href="../inv/el62.htm">KDOT Statewide TOC</a></th></tr></table><h3>Functional Requirements</h3><table><tr><th scope="col">ID</th><th scope="col">Requirement</th><th scope="col">User Defined</th></tr><tr><th scope="row" id="specialHighlight" >1</th><td>The center shall exchange alert information and status with emergency management centers.
