  <h2>MCM Roadway Maintenance Functional Object</h2>
<h3>Description</h3><p>'MCM Roadway Maintenance' provides overall management and support for routine maintenance on a roadway system or right&ndash;of&ndash;way.  Services managed include landscape maintenance, hazard removal (roadway debris, dead animals), routine maintenance activities (roadway cleaning, grass cutting), and repair and maintenance of non&ndash;ITS equipment on the roadway (e.g., signs, gantries, cabinets, guard rails, etc.).  Environmental conditions information is also received from various weather sources to aid in scheduling routine maintenance activities.
